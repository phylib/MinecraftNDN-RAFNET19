# Distributing the Game State of Online Games: Towards an NDN Version of Minecraft

This repository contains Data and Code to reproduce the results from our RAFNET'19
paper.

The repository is basically structured in three parts:

1. `data`.. Contains the network traces and change logs of the analyzed game.
2. `gamestate-changes`.. Contains scripts to trace the game state and to analyze the produced traces.
3. `network-trace-analysis`.. Contains scripts to analyze the recorded network traces.

More information on how to use the parts of the repository can be found in the `README.md` files of the subfolders.

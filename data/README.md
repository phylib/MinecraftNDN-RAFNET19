The network trace and game state change log file are too large for hosting it at GitHub. Therefore, the files are stored on a public FTP server of our institute. You can either manually download it from `http://ftp.itec.aau.at/icn/minecraft-ndn/RAFNET-19/`, or use the script to automatically download all required files.

    chmod +x clone-data.sh
    ./clone-data.sh

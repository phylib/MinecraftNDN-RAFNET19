# Tracing the game State

In order to trace the game state of a running Minecraft (Spigot) server, the `change_logger` plugin has to be enabled on the server. Instructions to install the plugin can be found in the `change_logger` folder.

Once the plugin was used to create a trace, the trace can be automized by the scripts in the `change_statistics` folder. More information on running the scripts can be found in the corresponding folder.
